#Todo Application README - 
This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the Todo application, which is built using React.js, Chakra-UI for the front end, and Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for the backend. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.

MongoDB: You will need a running MongoDB server. You can download and install MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community or use a cloud-hosted MongoDB service.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd todo-app/backend
Install backend dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Return to the root folder:

bash
Copy code
cd ..
Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
Backend Configuration
Create a .env file in the backend folder:

plaintext
Copy code
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
Replace <your-mongodb-uri> with the connection URI for your MongoDB database.

Frontend Configuration
No additional configuration is required for the frontend.

Running the Application
Start the backend server by navigating to the backend folder and running:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the Node.js server on port 3001.

In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend folder and start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the React application on port 3000 and open it in your default web browser.

Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. You can perform the following CRUD operations:

Create: Add new tasks by entering the task description and clicking the "Add Task" button.

Read: View the list of tasks on the main page.

Update: Click the "Edit" button next to a task to edit its description.

Delete: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
