Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your development machine. You can download them from nodejs.org.
MongoDB installed and running locally or accessible through a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas. You can install MongoDB from mongodb.com.
Setting Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory and configure the following environment variables:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
Replace your-mongodb-connection-string with your MongoDB connection string.

Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The backend server should now be running at http://localhost:3001.

Setting Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Open the src/api.js file and replace the BASE_URL variable with your deployed backend URL if you are using a deployed backend:

javascript
Copy code
const BASE_URL = 'your-deployed-backend-url';
If you are running the backend locally, you can leave it as-is (http://localhost:3001).

Running the Application
Start the frontend application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend should be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the Todo application.

Deployment
To deploy the backend and frontend of this application, you can use platforms like Heroku for the backend and Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages for the frontend. Make sure to update the respective deployment settings for your chosen platform.
